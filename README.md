# Flask Docker App - DevOps Pipeline

A complete DevOps pipeline demonstration that containerizes a Flask application and deploys it to AWS with VPC, load balancer, and scalable infrastructure.

##  What This Project Is About

This project demonstrates a **production-ready DevOps pipeline** for deploying web applications to AWS cloud infrastructure. It showcases how to transform a simple Flask application into a scalable, secure, and highly available cloud deployment using modern DevOps practices.

### Core Concept
Transform a basic Flask web application into a production-ready system with:
- **Containerization** for consistent deployments
- **Infrastructure as Code** for reproducible environments  
- **Load Balancing** for high availability
- **VPC networking** for security isolation
- **Automated deployment** for DevOps efficiency

### Architecture Flow
```
Flask App ‚Üí Docker Container ‚Üí AWS VPC ‚Üí Load Balancer ‚Üí Scalable Infrastructure
```

## üéØ Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
- **Demonstrate DevOps Best Practices**: Show how to implement a complete CI/CD pipeline
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Create production-ready AWS infrastructure with proper networking
- **Scalability**: Build systems that can handle increased load automatically
- **Security**: Implement proper security controls and network isolation
- **Automation**: Minimize manual intervention in deployment processes

### Learning Outcomes
- **Container Orchestration**: Understanding Docker containerization
- **Cloud Architecture**: AWS VPC, subnets, load balancers, and security groups
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform for reproducible infrastructure
- **DevOps Automation**: End-to-end deployment automation
- **Production Readiness**: Security, monitoring, and scalability considerations

## üöÄ What You Get

### Infrastructure Components
- **Custom VPC** with public and private subnets
- **Application Load Balancer** for traffic distribution
- **Auto Scaling** capabilities for handling load
- **Security Groups** with proper access controls
- **Internet Gateway** and routing tables

### Deployment Features
- **One-command deployment** from development to production
- **Docker image automation** with DockerHub integration
- **Infrastructure provisioning** with Terraform
- **Health monitoring** and application checks
- **Clean teardown** to avoid unnecessary costs
